App name: Zhiwei's weekly event list.

Introductionï¼šI can use this app to record my to-do list of each work day of the comming week, each time I enter a specific event adn click update, this event will be added into the event list of this specific day, click check and the list will be presented. The button 'clear' is used to clear all events that have been entered so far, so that the plan for next week can be entered. The button About simply directs to a new page that briefly describe what this app does. 

Some tech features used in this app: React native, JSX, Async Storage, useEffect hook, etc.

Here are two screenshots of this app:
